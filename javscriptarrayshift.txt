In this program, an array called myArray is created with some initial values.
 The shift() method is then used to remove the first element from the array. 
 The removed element is stored in the variable firstElement and the resulting 
 array is logged to the console. The shift() method returns the removed element, 
which can be stored and used elsewhere in the program.
